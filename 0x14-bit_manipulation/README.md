# Bit Manipulation in C

## Description
This project focuses on bit manipulation techniques in the C programming language. It covers fundamental operations such as converting binary to unsigned integers and printing binary representations of numbers.

## Files and Descriptions

| File Name            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `0-binary_to_uint.c` | Converts a binary number (string) to an unsigned integer. |
| `0-main.c`          | Test file for `0-binary_to_uint.c`. |
| `1-print_binary.c`  | Prints the binary representation of a number. |
| `1-main.c`         | Test file for `1-print_binary.c`. |
| `main.h`           | Header file containing function prototypes. |
| `_putchar.c`       | Function to print a character (used in binary printing). |
| `README.md`        | Documentation file for the project. |

## Compilation
To compile the files, use `gcc` with the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o bit_manipulation
```

## Usage
To run the program:

```sh
./bit_manipulation
```
